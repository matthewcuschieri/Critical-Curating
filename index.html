          1. Please re-read Elena Filipovic's text: What is an Exhibition, as I
          think this might be a helpful reminder of different ways one might
          approach exhibition making the subtle and not-so-subtle strategies
          that artists have utilized in reimagining what an exhibition can be.
          2. I think the exhibition can be organized one of several ways and I
          want to offer some examples to visit and perhaps riff off of: a) I
          believe I mentioned my former project space, Cleopatra's, exhibition
          where each founder brought in an object and throughout the duration of
          the exhibition participants were invited/scheduled to come in at
          different times and exchange one work for a new one that then went
          into the exhibition. We then documented this by having each exchange
          described on a document, which we then turned into a booklet. You
          could totally riff on this idea if you wanted to. We also organized a
          project, where we created a bookshelf and wrote to a range of cultural
          workers/curators we were inspired by and invited each of them to send
          us a book, which was then installed on the bookshelf for exhibition
          and later we turned the collection into a library in our space.
          Perhaps this is something you might want to play around with? b) Maybe
          you want to create obstructions in which the exhibition is
          reorganized. The film: The Five Obstructions was an experimental film
          in which the filmmaker Lars von Trier had his friend and mentor Jorgen
          Leth remake his famous film The Perfect Human five different times
          with five different obstructions.

          c) I do think it is worth revisiting the two Triple Candie exhibitions
          as possible approaches - Chloe presented on the Hammons exhibition and
          the other was Cady Noland. While complicated and ethically
          challenging, there might be something here as far as parameters and
          the expressed desire of working together to build something. It would
          also be good if you can start a text chain for each of your working
          groups. As. we have very little time, I need you to be working on this
          in and out of class. We cannot devote entiere classes to the final
          project, as there is still quite a bit to cover in our readings and
          discussions. The following needs to happen based on this timeline,
          please make note and discuss amongst one another: April 21: In working
          groups, begin press release, exhibition plan, checklist, online
          component April 28: Present to class and confirm the press release,
          exhibition plan, checklist, online presence May 5: Finalize checklist,
          fabrication, installation/deinstallation schedule, opening and
          programming May 12: May 19 (reading day): Is this when installation
          takes place? May 26: deinstallation, return of work and final
          walkthrough Let me know if you have any questions, Kate
