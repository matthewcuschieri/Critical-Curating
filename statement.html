    The Arecibo Message was the first radio signal sent by humanity sent to
    space in hopes of finding alien life. The broadcast, sent into a major star
    cluster, has yet to glean an answer. In ‘Arecibo: Missed Connections’ we
    examine what exactly a missed connection is, and what it entails to seek and
    not be responded to. These may be unanswered relationships with the world,
    or with strangers, or with our pasts. We evaluate what makes these mundane,
    open-ended realities ‘alien’.” Further, we hope to bring forth, through the
    works curated, the points of absence that emerge when these connections are
    lost — these gaps thus become the origins of creativity.
